== Introduction


{system-name} is a device designed to help pet owners feed their pets on time with the correct portion size. The device is powered by 230 VAC and is mounted on a wall above the pet's food bowl. It has a storage container that can hold dry food for at least a week and dispenses the food into the pet's bowl at a set time. The schedule is configurable, allowing the pet to be fed multiple times a day with different portion sizes. The device can detect when the storage container is getting low on food and will notify the caretaker when it's time to add more.

To configure the device, the pet owner can use a web browser to command the device and configure it to dispense the correct amount of dry food at a specified time, as many times a day as needed. The owner can configure multiple schedules, name them, and select which schedules are active at any given time using a web interface.

The device has an easy-to-use interface with buttons and a small display that allows the pet's caretaker to manually dispense dry food into the pet's bowl and stop the automatic feeding if needed. This is useful if the pet is not on the premises or if the caretaker wants to feed the pet manually with a different food than normal. It's also possible to cancel the next scheduled feeding but continue with the schedule after that. If there is an active feeding schedule, the onboard display will always show the next scheduled feeding time and the amount of dry food that will be dispensed.
 
Please note that this document is a living document, and will be updated as the project progresses.

[#.small]#_Ps. Naming of the device comes from the fact my dogs name is Huni and the device is intended to give him food_#.

== Interactions

The Actors(living entities) that interact with the device are the pet, the pet's caretaker and the pet's owner.
Each of them have different roles, responsibilities and knowledge.

== Project Plan

The {system-name} project is a significant undertaking that I started on {date-started}, and it will likely take over a year to complete. To manage the project, I will break it down into smaller, more manageable sections.

Since I will be working with technologies that I have not used before, I will need to research and create test projects to learn how to wire and use them. Additionally, I will need to design the device's external appearance and internal PCB.

To make the device presentable, I plan to 3D print the necessary parts and design the external appearance of {system-name} by creating a 3D model in Fusion 360 or Sketchup.

=== Project Sections

Quick breakdown, _to be visited later_.

. Figure out the requirements for the device (<<Introduction>>)
. Research the different technologies that will be used and create test projects to learn how to use them (<<Technical Research>>)
. 3D print the parts needed for the device
. Design the external look of {system-name} by drawing a 3d model of it in Fusion 360 or Sketchup (External Design document)
. Design a PCB to connect the different components to the microcontroller (PCB Design document)
.  Write the software
  * Controller code (Arduino)
  ** Libraries to communicate with the different sensors and motors.
  ** The web service (REST API)
  ** Support for VoffCon
  * Web interface (Web page)

== Technical Research

Getting the food from the container to the pet's bowl is the main task of the device.  
To do that, we need to figure out how to measure the amount of food in the container, and how to dispense the food into the pet's bowl.

To move the food from the storage container to the portion container, we use an auger.
An auger is a screw conveyor that moves the food slowly from the storage container to the portion container.
By doing this slowly, we should be able to measure the amount of food that has been added to the portion container and stop the auger when the correct amount of food has been added.

=== Device Components

The device will consist of several components, which will be listed in this chapter. If there are any components that I am not familiar with, I will conduct research and testing to become familiar with them. The results of the research and testing will be documented in a separate document, which will be linked to from this chapter.

==== Microcontroller

[grid=none,frame=none,cols="<.<~,<.^33%"]
|===
| _Esp32_ microcontroller will be used to control all the components and receive commands from the owner.

==== Portion load cell amplifier

[grid=none,frame=none,cols="<.<~,<.^33%"]
|===
| A _load cell amplifier_ will be used to amplify the signal from the <<Portion load cell>> to a level that the <<Microcontroller>> can read it.

This allows us to convert the signal into weigth an thus measure the amount of food in the portion container.

==== Storage load cell amplifier

[grid=none,frame=none,cols="<.<~,<.^33%"]
|===
| A _load cell amplifier_ will be used to amplify the signal from the <<Storage load cell>> to a level that the <<Microcontroller>> can read it.

This allows us to convert the signal into weigth an thus measure the amount of food left in the storage container.

==== Portion load cell

[grid=none,frame=none,cols="<.<~,<.^33%"]
|===
| A _load cell_ will be used to measure the amount of food for each portion.  
a| image::loadCell1kg.png[image]
|===



==== Storage load cell

[grid=none,frame=none,cols="<.<~,<.^33%"]
|===
| A _load cell_ will be used to detect, when the food container is getting empty.  

That is when is the amount of food in the food container is below a the portion amount.
a| image::loadCell5kg.png[image]

==== Portion motor driver

[grid=none,frame=none,cols="<.<~,<.^33%"]
|===
| A motor driver to transfer command from the <<Microcontroller>> to the <<Portion motor>>.
a| image::l298NDualBridgeStepperModerDriver.png[image,width=150]

==== Portion motor

[grid=none,frame=none,cols="<.<~,<.^33%"]
|===
| A Stepper motor to spin a <<Auger>> to move the food gradually from the food container to the food portion container.

==== Dispensing motor

[grid=none,frame=none,cols="<.<~,<.^33%"]
|===
| To dispense the food into the pet's bowl, we will use a servo motor.

When the portion container has the correct amount of food, the motor will open the <<Dispensing door>> to dispense the food into the pet's bowl.

==== Power supply

A 230 VAC to 12 VDC power supply will be used to power the device. To distribute the power to the different components, we will probably use a A _buck converter_ or _step-down converter_.

.The voltages probably needed are:
. *12 VDC* for the <<Portion motor>>
. *5 VDC* for the <<Microcontroller>> and some of the other components.
. *3.3 VDC* is possibly needed for some of the components.



==== Storage container

A container to hold the food.  This container will hold food for at least a week. The container should be removable for easy cleaning.
Underneath the container is a <<Storage load cell>> to measure the amount of food currently stored in the container.



==== Dispensing container
A container to hold the food that will be dispensed into the pet's bowl.  The container should be removable for easy cleaning.
Underneath the container is a <<Portion load cell>> to measure the amount of food currently in the container.



==== Auger

[grid=none,frame=none,cols="<.<~,<.^33%"]
|===
| An auger is a screw conveyor that moves the food slowly from the storage container to the portion container when it spins.
This component is moved by the <<Portion motor>>.

==== Dispensing door

A plate that opens and closes to dispense the food from the portion container into the pet's bowl.
This component is moved by the <<Dispensing motor>>.

=== Functional Specification

The Technical research needs to be done to figure out, which components to use and how to use them, before we can write the functional specification.

.Notes

The device will not provide a web interface, but will instead provide a REST API, which can be used by a web page to configure it.

todo: I need to decide if 

 * the device it's self should supply a web interface
 * Should we only support VoffCon
 * Should I write a webpage which is not a VoffCon page, and that webpage uses the devices web service to communicate with it.

todo: add an descriptive image of where most of the components are placed.
// .An functional descriptive image should be drawn and placed here.
